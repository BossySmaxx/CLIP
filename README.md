## ✨ Features

-   🔁 Real-time clipboard syncing over LAN
-   ⚡ Lightning-fast peer-to-peer communication
-   🧠 Smart updates (no duplicates)
-   🔐 Local-only — no data leaves your network
-   💻 Cross-device: works across all your Windows devices (Support for other OS/System will be added soon)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

CLIP uses local network broadcasting to discover nearby devices and establish WebSocket connections between them. Once connected, clipboard data is shared instantly but <b>not securely (data encryption will added soon.)</b> — without using the internet.
